   4) Numpy

   5) Pandas

 

When to use Numpy and when to use Pandas:
Pandas:
Pandas provides high level data manipulation tools built on top of NumPy. 
Indexing
Renaming
Handling missing values
map(), apply(), applymap()
groupby()
New Columns = f(Existing Columns)
Basic stats
Merge, join
Plots
Numpy:
Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
NumPy by itself is a fairly low-level tool, and will be very much similar to using MATLAB. 

speed,functionality,efficiency,convenience,less space/memory



 

Usage of Tuples, List
